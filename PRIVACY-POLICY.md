## Camera Permission & QR Scanning — Optic Qr

**Effective date:** May 13, 2026

---

### Overview

Optic Qr uses your device camera **exclusively** to scan QR codes. This section explains what we use the camera for, what data (if any) we collect, how it is processed, and how you can control the permission.

### Why we request Camera permission

* **Purpose:** The camera is required to allow the app to read and decode QR codes (URLs, text, contact details, Wi-Fi network info, etc.). Without camera access, the real-time scanning feature cannot function.
* **Scope:** Camera access is only requested while you are using the scanning feature. The app does not attempt to access the camera when the scanner is not active.

### How camera data is handled

* **Local processing:** Frames captured by the camera are processed locally on your device to detect and decode QR codes. We **do not** transmit raw camera frames to any server for scanning or processing.
* **No persistent upload:** By default, camera images or video frames are not uploaded, stored remotely, or shared with third parties.
* **User-initiated saves:** If you choose to save or export an image (e.g., saving a generated or scanned QR image to your gallery), the saved image will be stored on your device. Any sharing of those saved images is done by you explicitly via share sheets or exports.
* **Logs & metadata:** We do not collect or associate camera images with a user account (there is no account system). Minimal non-identifiable usage telemetry may be collected for crash reporting; such telemetry **never** includes raw camera images or decoded content.

### Permissions & Control

* **Granting permission:** The app requests camera permission the first time you open the scanning feature. You can grant or deny it.
* **Revoking permission:** You can revoke camera permission at any time through your device settings:
> **Settings** → **Apps** → **Optic Qr** → **Permissions** → **Camera**


* **Denial fallback:** If camera permission is denied, you can still use other app features that do not require the camera, such as creating QR codes from text.

### Third-party services and SDKs

* We do not send camera frames to third-party services.
* Any third-party SDKs used are evaluated to ensure they do not access camera frames or decode images off-device without explicit disclosure and consent.

### Data retention and deletion

* **Camera frames are ephemeral:** Frames used for scanning are processed in memory and discarded once decoded. We do not retain raw camera images.
* **Saved images:** Images you save explicitly to your gallery remain on your device until you delete them.
* **Support requests:** If you submit a bug report including screenshots, those will be handled according to our standard support/privacy practices.

### Security & Legal

* **Security:** We follow standard industry security practices to protect data stored on the device.
* **Compliance:** We request only the permissions necessary for the stated functionality. Camera access is the minimum required to provide scanning.
* **GDPR/Local Laws:** If you are subject to specific local privacy laws, please use the contact details below for privacy requests.
